\begin{abstract}
We present \texttt{tf::tree}, a high-performance, open-source
spatial hierarchy for general-purpose geometry processing.
It combines a data-oriented, balanced n-ary structure with
in-place partitioning—driven by a pluggable framework of
state-of-the-art selection algorithms—to achieve real-time
construction speeds. Its novel Top-K sorted stack traversal
outperforms traditional heap-based methods for proximity
queries by up to $3\times$. The system supports real-time
queries, including collision, proximity, and (self)
intersections, even on models with millions of primitives,
making \texttt{tf::tree} a versatile and efficient foundation
for complex geometric tasks.
