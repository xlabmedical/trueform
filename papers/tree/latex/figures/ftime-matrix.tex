    Heatmap comparing the performance of Top-K Sorted Stack
    traversal versus Priority Queue for nearness queries across
    various tree configurations (varying tree arity and leaf size).
    The values represent the relative speed-up factor. Results
    indicate that the performance benefit of Top-K Sorted Stack
    increases with higher tree arity.}
